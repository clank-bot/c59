        <p> A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.
            Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
            My hobby is Gaming. I love Gaming on my laptop very much. The few games that i like are Minecraft, Roblox, Boom Beach, Enslaved, Ratchet and clank, Among us etc. There are many games in the world some of them help us with patience, communication skills, critical thinking skills etc. They are helpful as you can play with your friends and learn the impostance of teamwork.</p>
